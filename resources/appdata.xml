    <p>
        CraftOS-PC is a fantasy terminal that allows you to write and run 
        programs inside an '80s-style text console.
    </p>
    <p>
        CraftOS-PC emulates the popular Minecraft mod "ComputerCraft", which 
        adds programmable computers to Minecraft using the Lua programming 
        language. CraftOS-PC takes this experience outside Minecraft to allow 
        you to run the same programs anywhere you go.
    </p>
    <p>
        CraftOS-PC provides a set of functions (called APIs) that make it super 
        easy to do simple tasks such as write text to the screen, read files, 
        and more. The simplicity of these functions makes CraftOS-PC great for 
        new programmers, but their power makes it possible to write all sorts of
        complex programs with less code.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you aren't ready to write programs yet, there's already a large 
        number of programs for ComputerCraft that will work in CraftOS-PC, 
        ranging from simple games to whole graphical operating systems. These 
        can be downloaded through the built-in Pastebin and GitHub Gist clients.
