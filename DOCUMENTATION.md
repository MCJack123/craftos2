# New feature documentation
This file provides documentation for the new APIs in CraftOS-PC.

## Creating new computers
Computers can be created with `periphemu.create("computer_<id>", "computer")`, where `<id>` is the ID of the new computer. If a computer with the ID is already open, it will not create a new one. The `computer` peripheral for the new computer will also be attached.  
If the peripheral is detached with `periphemu.remove`, the peripheral will be detached but the computer window will stay open. To close the computer from Lua, call `peripheral.call("computer_<id>", "shutdown")`, and the peripheral will automatically be detached.  
Computers can also be attached and detached from the shell when using the CraftOS ROM with `attach computer_<id> computer` and `detach computer_<id>`, respectively.

## Command line interface
On supported systems, CraftOS-PC can be run from the terminal with the `--cli` flag. You can use Shift+Arrow Keys to change the currently open window. In this mode, some features are not supported, including:
* Holding keys: CLI mode cannot detect key releases, and thus sends both a `key` and `key_up` event at the same time. Because of this, it cannot detect if you are holding any keys down.
* Using modifier keys: CLI mode cannot detect pressing modifier keys, so CraftOS-PC works around that by using the Home key as Control and the End key as Alt. To send Home/End to CraftOS, hold down Shift while pressing the key.

## Using custom fonts
The font used for CraftOS-PC can be changed in `<save dir>/config/global.json`, with the `customFontPath` option. To set the font, set `customFontPath` to the absolute path to a BMP file containing the font glyphs. Each glyph must be exactly 6*s* x 9*s* px with 2*s* pixels between each glyph, where *s* is a number representing the scale of the font. `customFontScale` must also be set to a number representing the size of the font (1 = HD font (12x18), 2 = normal font (6x9), 3 = 1/2 size font (4x6)).

For example, if the CCEmuX `hdfont.bmp` is placed at `/usr/share/craftos/hdfont.bmp`, we can add this to `global.json`:
```json
"customFontPath": "/usr/share/craftos/hdfont.bmp",
"customFontScale": 1
```

## Plugin API
CraftOS-PC 2 features a new plugin API that allows easy addition of new C APIs into the environment. 
A plugin consists of a shared library (`.dll`, `.dylib`, `.so`) that contains a function named `luaopen_<name>`, where `<name>` is the filename of the plugin.
Upon loading a new computer, the `plugins` folder inside the install directory is scanned for plugins to load.
For each plugin found, CraftOS-PC loads and calls the plugin's `luaopen` function. This function should have the same signature as a `lua_CFunction`:
```
int luaopen_plugin(lua_State *L);
```
The function will recieve the ROM path and the base path, and should return one value: the API that will be exported to the global table.  
Plugins must also have an exported function named `version`, which tells CraftOS-PC what version of the API it's using.
As of v2.2, the version is currently `2`. You can use the template `version` function in the example below.
If this version number changes, make sure to update the version in your plugin and recompile to ensure full compatibility.

If your plugin needs access to the CraftOS-PC `Computer` object, copy the `get_comp(L)` function in `lib.cpp`.
This function takes in a `lua_State` and returns a pointer to the `Computer` object associated with it.
You can then access the properties of the computer.
The `Computer` object also has a userdata property that allows temporary per-computer storage if necessary.  

When compiling a plugin, make sure to link in the custom `craftos2-lua` library instead of the original Lua library.
  
Here's an example of a C plugin (from https://github.com/mostvotedplaya/Lua-C-Module):
```c
#include <lua.h>
#include <lauxlib.h>
#define PLUGIN_VERSION 2

int addition(lua_State *L) {
    if (!lua_isnumber(L, 1)) {
        return luaL_error(L, "Expecting first parameter to be typeof: number");
    }

    if (!lua_isnumber(L, 2)) {
        return luaL_error(L, "Expecting second parameter to be typeof: number");
    }

    int addition = lua_tonumber(L, 1) + lua_tonumber(L, 2);
    lua_pushnumber(L, addition);
    return 1;
}

int multiply(lua_State *L) {
    if (!lua_isnumber(L, 1)) {
        return luaL_error(L, "Expecting first parameter to be typeof: number");
    }

    if (!lua_isnumber(L, 2)) {
        return luaL_error(L, "Expecting second parameter to be typeof: number");
    }

    int multiply = lua_tonumber(L, 1) * lua_tonumber(L, 2);
    lua_pushnumber(L, multiply);
    return 1;
}

#ifdef _WIN32
_declspec(dllexport) 
#endif
int luaopen_example(lua_State *L) {
    struct luaL_Reg M[] =
    {
      {"addition", addition},
      {"multiply", multiply},
      {NULL,NULL}
    };

    luaL_Register(L, "example", M);
    return 1;
}

#ifdef _WIN32
_declspec(dllexport) 
#endif
int version(lua_State *L) {lua_pushinteger(L, PLUGIN_VERSION); return 1;}
```
Compile as a shared library and copy to:
* Windows: `C:\Program Files\CraftOS-PC\plugins\example.dll`
* Mac: `CraftOS-PC.app/Contents/Resources/plugins/example.dylib`
* Linux: `/usr/share/craftos/plugins/example.so`

When booting a new computer, the `example` API will be available in the global table.  
I've also added a binding for the CCEmuX API in `examples/ccemux.cpp`.
