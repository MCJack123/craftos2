/**
 * The PluginFunctions structure is used to hold all of the functions that a
 * plugin may use to interact with CraftOS-PC. This structure is passed (as a
 * constant pointer) to the `plugin_init` function.
 *
 * There are two different version fields in this structure. The first,
 * abi_version, is used to determine the version of the ABI. Changes to this
 * version indicate a fundamental incompatibility, and you should not continue
 * loading if this version doesn't match the expected version.
 *
 * The second field, structure_version, is used to determine what functions are
 * exported in both the Computer and PluginFunctions structure. This version is
 * bumped when new fields are added to one of the structure definitions. Check
 * this field before using any fields added after structure version 0. It is
 * not required that this field exactly match - as long as the version is
 * greater than or equal to the minimum that your plugin requires to function,
 * you may continue loading.
 *
 * Do NOT rely on any non-version-0 fields to exist without checking the
 * structure version. If you do this, users using your plugin on an old version
 * of CraftOS-PC will likely experience a segmentation fault/crash when the
 * plugin attempts to load the non-existing function. Instead, you should check
 * that the structure version is compatible, and warn or error that the plugin
 * is incompatible with the current version (without crashing).
 *
 * Do note that if your plugin doesn't require any CraftOS-PC structures during
 * initialization, you can let CraftOS-PC handle version checks by returning an
 * info structure with the required versions filled in (see below). If the
 * version numbers don't match, CraftOS-PC will stop loading your plugin.
 * However, this will not suffice if you need to access the structures in your
 * plugin_init.
 *
 * You may see references to version numbers in the form xx.yy - this is a
 * shorthand form to represent <abi_version>.<structure_version>.
